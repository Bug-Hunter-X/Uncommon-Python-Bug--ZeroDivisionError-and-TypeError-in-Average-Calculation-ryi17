This repository demonstrates an uncommon Python bug related to error handling in average calculation. The `bug.py` file contains code that calculates the average of a list of numbers but fails to handle empty lists or lists with non-numeric elements.  The `bugSolution.py` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling.  This showcases the importance of robust error handling for creating reliable and stable Python programs.
